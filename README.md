# dev-practice-labs

A technical sandbox featuring hands-on builds to explore multiple technologies, programming concepts, architectural patterns, code enhancement techniques, and full-stack development workflows.

This repository is a personal lab where I experiment with diverse tech stacksâ€”ranging from frontend interfaces to backend APIs and full-stack integrations. It includes small apps, feature demos, and practice projects designed to deepen my understanding and improve problem-solving with real-world development patterns.
